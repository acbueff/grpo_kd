# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will show how to use multiple GPUs when training with
PyTorch. If you are going to parallelize your work-load there are primarily two
different approaches:
 - Data Parallelism
 - Model Parallelism

With data parallelism you will have your model broadcast to all GPUs and then
have separete batches on the different GPUs calculate the weight updates in
parallel and then summarise into an update as if you had had a single large
batch. This is useful if you have a large dataset and want to have larger
batches than fit on the GPUs memory.

Model parallelism is about storing parts of the model on different GPUs. This is
used if your model is too large to fit on a single GPU, for the GPUs available
on Alvis this should rarely be a problem but in some rare cases you might reach
this limit. Remember that you can see your resource usage for a job with the
command `job_stats.py`. 

## Pytorch

### Environment setup
To run these examples load pytorch:
```bash
ml purge
ml PyTorch-bundle/2.1.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1
ml matplotlib/3.7.2-gfbf-2023a
ml JupyterLab/4.0.5-GCCcore-12.3.0
```

### Data Parallelism with DP
The simplest option for Data Parallelism on a single node is
[Data Parallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.DataParallel.html)
(DP). However, this is not the recomended way (see PyTorch Documentation for
details on why), but we will go through how it can be used anyway. 

To use DP you wrap your model
```python
model = ...
model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model)
model = model.to("cuda")
```
and then this wrapper will chunk the batch to each forward and distribute them
to model replicas on each device.


### Data Parallelism with DDP
In this part we will take a look at Distributed Data Parallel (DDP).
According to the
[PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html)
DDP is currently the go to method for data parallelism even on a single node.

DDP works differently from DP by running on several different processes. There are a few different options, but we recommend to launch with `torchrun`.

### Excercises
1. Checkout the different scripts and try to get an idea of what they are doing and what their differences are.
2. Submit jobscripts and see the different outputs, try with verbose=True for the model to see the size of the inputs.
3. From 2 you might note that for DDP all the processes process all the data. Checkout `torch.utils.data.DistributedSampler` and modify one of the scripts such that the data actually becomes distributed over the different devices
4. Play around with different sizes of the dataset, different models and sizes of models, and/or different number of nodes. Check out the Grafana generated by `job_stats.py YOUR_JOBID_HERE`, are you using all GPUs? To what extent? You might have to increase dataset size or other things such that the job runs long enough to show up on the grafana plots.

## TensorFlow
TensorFlow has their own [guide to distributed training](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training)
which is a good reference to know of. Here we will cover some of that material.

### Environment setup
To run these examples load pytorch:
```bash
module purge
ml TensorFlow/2.15.1-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1
ml matplotlib/3.7.2-gfbf-2023a
ml JupyterLab/4.0.5-GCCcore-12.3.0
```

### Data Parallelism with MirroredStrategy
In TensorFlow distributed training is handled by strategies. A strategy is
defined such as `MirroredStrategy` and then any variables created in this
strategies scope will be handled in a distributed fashion. For example:
```python
strategy = tf.distributed.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    my_model = MyModel()
    my_model.compile(# usual stuff here
    )

# ... use model as usual
```
