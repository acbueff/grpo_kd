Based on the codebase search results, I can provide a detailed summary of the GRPO training implementation:

### Model and Dataset
- **Base Model**: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
- **Dataset**: GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)
- **Dataset Split**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets, with the training set used for GRPO optimization and the validation set for evaluation

### GRPO Training Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset is processed specifically for GRPO training using `prepare_for_grpo()` method
   - Each problem is paired with its reference solution
   - The data is formatted to include prompts and reference solutions

2. **Training Configuration** (from `grpo_config.yaml`):
   - Number of epochs: 5
   - Maximum steps: 20,000
   - Mini-batch size: 8
   - Batch size: 128
   - Learning rate: 1.0e-5
   - GRPO-specific epochs: 3 (number of GRPO optimization passes per batch)
   - Preference threshold: 0.1
   - Beta (regularization coefficient): 0.1

3. **Key Components**:
   - **Preference Model**: A BERT-based model that learns to predict preferences between response pairs
   - **Reward Model**: Computes rewards based on:
     - Mathematical correctness (weight: 1.0)
     - Reasoning process (weight: 0.5)
     - Brevity (weight: 0.1)
   - **KL Divergence**: Used as a penalty to keep the model close to the reference policy

4. **Training Process**:
   - For each batch:
     - Generates pairs of responses for each prompt
     - Computes rewards for each response
     - Normalizes rewards to compute advantages
     - Estimates KL divergence from reference policy
     - Updates model parameters using the GRPO loss function
   - Uses paired sampling with:
     - Number of sample pairs: 64
     - Paired batch size: 16
     - Temperature range: (0.7, 1.3) for diversity

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Performed every 200 steps
   - Uses a separate validation set
   - Saves best model based on evaluation performance
   - Checkpoints are saved every 500 steps

6. **Implementation Details**:
   - Uses CUDA for GPU acceleration when available
   - Implements gradient clipping (max_grad_norm: 1.0)
   - Uses AdamW optimizer with cosine learning rate scheduler
   - Supports distributed training
   - Includes logging and monitoring capabilities

7. **Output and Results**:
   - Model checkpoints are saved to `/proj/berzelius-aiics-real/users/x_anbue/ppo_grpo/models/grpo_finetuned`
   - Training statistics and evaluation results are saved to separate directories
   - Tensorboard logging is supported for monitoring training progress

### Reimplementation Notes
1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 16GB memory
   - Required packages: PyTorch, Transformers, Datasets

2. **Key Files**:
   - `src/rl/grpo_trainer.py`: Main GRPO implementation
   - `configs/grpo_config.yaml`: Training configuration
   - `scripts/run_grpo_training.py`: Training script
   - `data/prepare_data.py`: Data preparation utilities

3. **Important Parameters to Consider**:
   - `preference_threshold`: Controls how strong preferences need to be to affect training
   - `beta`: Balances between reward optimization and staying close to reference policy
   - `num_sample_pairs`: Affects diversity of training samples
   - `paired_temperature`: Controls diversity in response generation

4. **Potential Challenges**:
   - High computational requirements
   - Need for careful tuning of preference and reward weights
   - Memory management for large batch sizes
   - Training stability with the paired optimization approach

This implementation represents a sophisticated approach to fine-tuning language models using preference-based reinforcement learning, with careful attention to both mathematical correctness and reasoning quality.
