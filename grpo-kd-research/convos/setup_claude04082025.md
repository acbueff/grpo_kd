We've successfully set up a comprehensive research project focused on enhancing Faroese language models through knowledge distillation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) techniques.

## Project Implementation Summary

1. **Core Algorithms**
   - Implemented GRPO algorithm with teacher log-likelihood rewards and optional language modeling loss
   - Implemented PPO algorithm with value function and multiple optimization epochs
   - Created utility functions for both approaches (group statistics, optimizers, seed control)

2. **Reward Mechanisms**
   - Developed teacher log-probability reward system for knowledge distillation
   - Implemented language modeling reward (L_PT) for preserving pre-training capabilities
   - Created Faroese-specific reward variants with special handling of Faroese characters
   - Implemented reward combiners for different reward strategies (linear, non-linear, MiniLLM-style)

3. **Model Infrastructure**
   - Set up Faroese tokenizer adapter with special token handling for Faroese characters
   - Created model configurations for student models (Mistral-7B) and teacher models (GEMMA-27B)
   - Implemented memory-efficient loading strategies for large teacher models

4. **Training Infrastructure**
   - Developed distributed training utilities for multi-GPU setups
   - Created checkpointing system for saving/loading model states
   - Implemented logging utilities for experiment tracking
   - Set up DeepSpeed integration for memory-efficient training

5. **Evaluation System**
   - Created FaroeseEvaluator with metrics specific to Faroese language tasks
   - Implemented FoQA (Faroese Question Answering) evaluation configuration
   - Added metrics like perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and Faroese-specific linguistic metrics

6. **Configuration System**
   - Created detailed YAML configurations for all training approaches:
     - GRPO with Teacher Log-Likelihood
     - GRPO with MiniLLM-style rewards
     - PPO with Teacher Log-Likelihood
     - PPO with MiniLLM-style rewards
   - Set up model-specific configurations with Faroese adaptations

7. **HPC Integration**
   - Created SLURM scripts for training on HPC clusters
   - Implemented gradient checkpointing and mixed precision for memory efficiency
   - Set up DeepSpeed Zero-2 optimization for distributed training

## Potential Next Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Create or acquire Faroese language datasets for training and evaluation
   - Preprocess and format data for the training pipeline

2. **Initial Experiments**
   - Run baseline training with both GRPO and PPO approaches
   - Compare performance of teacher log-likelihood vs. MiniLLM-style rewards
   - Analyze impact on Faroese language performance

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
   - Fine-tune key parameters like learning rate, group size, and reward weights
   - Experiment with different KL penalties and L_PT weights

4. **Enhanced Evaluation**
   - Develop more Faroese-specific evaluation benchmarks
   - Implement automated evaluation pipelines
   - Create visualization tools for result analysis

5. **Ablation Studies**
   - Measure impact of Faroese-specific adaptations
   - Analyze contribution of different reward components
   - Compare performance across model sizes and architectures

6. **Documentation and Publication**
   - Document experimental results and findings

   - Open-source the trained Faroese language models

7. **Scaling and Optimization**
   - Scale to larger teacher models or smaller student models
   - Optimize inference speed for practical applications
   - Develop efficient fine-tuning methods for downstream tasks
